# Contributing to flutter-apps

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes with 100% test coverage.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions will be understood under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/albinpk/flutter-apps/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/albinpk/flutter-apps/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports using [this](https://github.com/albinpk/flutter-apps/issues/new?assignees=albinpk&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=bug%28%3Cscope%3E%29%3A+) template

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce (give sample code if you can)
- What you expected would happen
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- We use [flutter_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints) for linting

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
